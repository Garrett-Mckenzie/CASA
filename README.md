# Rappahannock CASA 

## Purpose
This project is the result of a semester's worth of collaboration among UMW students. The goal of the project was to create a web application that better suits the needs of Rappahannock CASA, specifically as a system to manage their donors. 

## Authors
In Fall 2025, the Fredericksburg SCPA Volunteer Management Web Application code was adapted to develop the Rappahannock CASA Web Application. Numerous existing database tables were retained with modifications or renamed, while new tables were introduced as needed. Certain files and functionalities from the original system were integrated, while additional features were designed specifically for the Rappahannock CASA Web Application. The team responsible for these updates and enhancements included Garrett Mckenzie, Ethan Bostick, Joshua Byrne, Max Redman, Carter Walker, and James Heathcock.
