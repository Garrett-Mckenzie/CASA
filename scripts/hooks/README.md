# Steps to set up automatic DB dumps

overview: this process will copy a "hook" called post-merge (no extension) into the .git/hooks directory for our project, this script will run after every git pull
the scripts are available in the scripts folder that are in the project repo; depending on your os and terminal configuration, different scripts and proccess will be needed

1) pull the most recent repo ``git pull``

2) go to your project directory in your terminal (i.e. directory that contains the .git, and other project files)
### macOS/Linux/Git Bash Users: 
3) from the project directory run the following terminal commands: ``cp scripts/hooks/post-merge.bash .git/hooks/post-merge``
4) then give the new script executable: ``chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge``
### Windows CMD / PowerShell
3) from the project directory run the following terminal commands: ``copy scripts\hooks\post-merge.bat .git\hooks\post-merge``
4) no need to give the script executable, continue to next steps
### Continue
5) update the scripts with the correct information (newly copied script is located in .git/hooks):
	a) edit the post-merge file using vim or what ever editor you use
	b) the top of the file has information you must verify:
		- db name = the name of your local database (i.e. casadb) [not the name of the .sql file]
		- db user = should just be root, check your phpMyAdmin in the casadb Privileges (i dont have those) tab
		- db pass = should just be blank, pretty sure we set it to blank for everyone
		- sql file= file path to the .sql dump file passed around through git
		- ** mysql bin = this one needs to be looked at, it is the location of your mysql client in your local xampp host **
		  **NOTE: the mysql bin path will look different depending on your os and where the file actually is**
		  macOS XAMPP ex: `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/mysql`
		  Windows XAMPP ex:`C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe`

6) you can test and run the new script manually with the terminal cmd and putting in your db password (see step 5: if blank just press enter): ``.git/hooks/post-merge``
7) From now on, whenever you git pull or git merge:
- The post-merge hook runs automatically.
- It imports db.sql into the local database.
- If MySQL isnâ€™t running, the hook prints a warning and skips import.
- you will then need to manually run the script to pull the db changes (see step 6)
